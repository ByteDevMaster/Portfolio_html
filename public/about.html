<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey there! I'm Garv Garg — a quietly curious creator, a code enthusiast, and someone who believes that even the smallest line of HTML can shape a big experience.</p>

<p>I'm not just someone who builds websites — I engineer logic. From crafting elegant front-ends in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to diving into raw memory with C or scripting smart automation in Python, I see code not just as syntax, but as storytelling.</p>

<p>My journey didn’t begin in a lecture hall. It began with a simple urge: “What if I could build something that talks back?” That spark led me to design interactive pages, write efficient algorithms, and build things that simply... work.</p>

<p>Whether I’m stitching together pixels on a webpage or managing data flow on the backend, I bring structure, clarity, and a bit of soul into every project. Python taught me logic. C taught me control. Web taught me expression. And together, they built my perspective.</p>

<p>I’m currently shaping myself into a full-stack developer — one who understands both the look and the logic of the web. It's not just about code running; it's about it running right.</p>

<p>Off the screen? I'm the guy who might discuss Marvel timelines, overthink UI colors, or name variables after Avengers (don’t judge). I’m humble, sharp, and just unpredictable enough to be interesting. Or so I've been told 😄</p>

<p>Welcome to my digital space — raw, real, and always evolving. Just like the code I write. Just like me.</p>
